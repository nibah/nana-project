	Merge multi edges into single weighted edges.

	INPUT:
	- ``graph`` -- A NetworkX MultiDiGraph.
	- ``undirected -- Boolean, indicating if the output should be an undirected graph.
	- ``threshold`` -- A real number from 0 to 1, used to calculate edge sign
	if the output graph is undirected. A higher threshold will delete edges
	that have ambiguous sentiment. For example, a threshold of 1/3 means that
	an edge (u,v) in the output undirected graph will exist and have a sign
	only if more than 2/3 of the edges (u,v) or (v,u) in the original directed
	multigraph were of that same sign.

	OUTPUT:
	- ``graph`` -- A NetworkX DiGraph where each edge has a new attribute 'WEIGHT'.
	Alternatively, if ``undirected`` is True, a NetworkX Graph where each edge also
	has the attribute ``SIGN``, calculated using link sentiment of the input graph.
